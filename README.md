# Text-Mining-for-Gene-Gene-Interactions
Application for extracting gene-gene interactions involved in Atherosclerosis from PUBMED abstracts using Stanford's NLP Library and [DeepDive](http://deepdive.stanford.edu)

## READ PDF FILE FIRST!
If this is your first time using DeepDive, I highly encourage you to go over the entire PDF of the Tutorial first. 

## /input
Contains the text corpora to be read by DeepDive. This is a collection of half a million PUBMED abstracts on Atherosclerosis

## /udf
Stands for "User Defined Functions" which will tell DeepDive how to identify co-ocurring pairs of genes in Atherosclerosis
